# My First Linux Project: Building a Mock Office for a Cybersecurity Company

Hey there! So, I’m diving into the world of **Linux administration**, and I thought, what better way to get my feet wet than to build a **mock office environment** for a cybersecurity company? Sure, I’m not sure yet if I’ll land a **sysadmin** role, but I’m taking it one step at a time. This project is my first hands-on attempt at learning Linux and gaining some real experience that’ll help me in **cybersecurity**, **DevOps**, and maybe even **cloud** someday.

## Why This Project?

Honestly, I wanted something practical to get started with Linux—something that would give me a feel for how things work in the real world. Setting up a mock office for a cybersecurity company gives me the perfect chance to practice creating users, managing access, and organizing files, all of which will be super useful down the line.

## Step 1: Creating Groups for Each Department

In an office, you’ve got different teams working on different stuff, so I figured it would make sense to organize the users into departments. I made four departments for this project: **IT**, **HR**, **Finance**, and **Cybersecurity**. Each department gets its own group.

### Linux Commands:
```bash
sudo groupadd IT
sudo groupadd HR
sudo groupadd Finance
sudo groupadd Cybersecurity
